# LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) Optimizations

## Overview
This document outlines the optimizations implemented to improve the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) metric, which is a key Core Web Vital that measures the time it takes for the largest content element to become visible within the viewport.

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Resource Preloading
- Added `<link rel="preload">` directives in the HTML head for critical resources
- Implemented preconnect for external domains (fonts, etc.)
- Created a custom hook `usePreloadCriticalImages` to preload important images

### 2. Image Loading Optimizations
- Enhanced `ImageLoader` component with priority loading capabilities
- Added `fetchPriority="high"` attribute for critical images
- Implemented `loading="eager"` for above-the-fold images
- Added `decoding="sync"` for critical images to prioritize their processing

### 3. Build Optimizations
- Configured Vite build settings for optimal chunking
- Implemented manual chunk splitting for better caching
- Optimized dependency loading with `optimizeDeps`

### 4. Performance Utilities
- Enhanced image preloading utilities
- Added support for the Fetch Priority API
- Implemented dynamic link preload tag generation

## How These Optimizations Improve LCP

1. **Resource Prioritization**: Critical resources are loaded first, ensuring the largest content element appears quickly.

2. **Reduced Render-Blocking**: By preloading critical CSS and scripts, we minimize render-blocking resources.

3. **Optimized Image Loading**: The most important images (hero images, etc.) are loaded with high priority before other content.

4. **Efficient Caching**: Better build chunking improves caching efficiency for returning visitors.

## Measuring Impact

To measure the impact of these optimizations:

1. Use Chrome DevTools Performance panel
2. Check Core Web Vitals in Google Search Console
3. Run Lighthouse audits before and after implementation
4. Monitor real user metrics with tools like Google Analytics

## Future Considerations

- Implement responsive image loading with srcset
- Consider using next-gen image formats (WebP, AVIF)
- Explore critical CSS extraction
- Implement service workers for offline caching
