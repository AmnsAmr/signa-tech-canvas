# New Features Implementation

## 🛡️ Authentication & Secure Contact Forms

### Features Added:
- **User Authentication**: Login/Register system with JWT tokens
- **Protected Contact Forms**: Users must be logged in to submit contact requests
- **Secure Backend**: All submissions are associated with authenticated users
- **Session Management**: Automatic token validation and user session handling

### How it works:
1. Users must click "Login" in the header to authenticate
2. New users can register with name, email, password, company, and phone
3. Only authenticated users can access and submit the contact form
4. All submissions are stored in the database with user association

## ⚙️ Backend Integration

### New API Endpoints:
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user info
- `POST /api/contact/submit` - Submit contact form (protected)
- `GET /api/admin/users` - Get all users (admin only)
- `GET /api/admin/submissions` - Get all submissions (admin only)

### Database:
- **SQLite Database**: Automatically created on first run
- **Users Table**: Stores user information and roles
- **Contact Submissions Table**: Stores all form submissions with detailed specs
